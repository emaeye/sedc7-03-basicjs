# Christmass Tree

Write a Javascript function that will draw a christmass tree on the console. The functions takes one parameter - the number of rows the tree should have. The first row of the tree will have a single start, and each subsequent row will have two stars to the left and right of the previous row. After the rows the trunk of the tree is two rows with a single star each.

For example, the call

```javascript
drawChristmassTree(5)
```
will generate the following tree:

<pre>

        *  
      * * *  
    * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * *
        *
        *

</pre>

**bonus** Make a function that draws a cristmass tree but takes two parameters - the **width** of the tree and the **height** of the tree. For example, the tree shown on the example will be generated by `drawChristassTree2(9, 7)`. Note: Do proper validation of the input values
