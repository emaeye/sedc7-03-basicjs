# Range generation

Given a starting and a finishing number, generate an array that will have as elements all the numbers starting with the starting and ending with the finishing number, e.g., `generateRange(5, 10)` should return the array `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

**bonus** Make the function work if the starting number is bigger than the finishing number, e.g. `generateRange(10, 5)` should return the array `[10, 9,8, 7, 6, 5]`.
